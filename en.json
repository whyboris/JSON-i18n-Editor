    "faq": {
        "heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "q1": "Should the Health Impact Fund replace the existing system of incentives?",
        "q1_answer": "Clearly: no. The conventional incentives from patent-protected markups remain in place. The Health Impact Fund merely gives pharmaceutical innovators the additional option of registering a new medicine and then receiving reward payments according to health impact.",
        "q2": "How is the Health Impact Fund financed?",
        "q2_answer": "The Health Impact Fund might be financed by states, for example, most plausibly in proportion to their gross national incomes. Another possible source of funding are international taxes, which might be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions or on certain destabilizing financial transactions.",
        "q3": "How much money does the Health Impact Fund require?",
        "q3_answer": "A stable and efficient Health Impact Fund would require at least €3 billion per year. Of course, it could also work with a larger amount and would then attract a larger number of product registrations.",
        "q4": "Is this amount realistic?",
        "q4_answer": "€3 billion per year is less than 0.3% of what the world currently spends on pharmaceuticals. If all countries participated, then each would need to contribute merely 0.0036% of its gross national income to the Health Impact Fund. And these contributions would be offset by substantial savings through better health and productivity worldwide.",
        "q5": "What if some affluent countries initially don’t want to contribute? ",
        "q5_answer": "Their abstention would have some positive effects as well: medicines that are registered with the Health Impact Fund could still be sold with large patent-protected markups in such non-contributing affluent countries. This opportunity would make registration more attractive for pharmaceutical firms to register a new medicine and would also give non-contributing states an incentive to join the Health Impact Fund scheme.",
        "q6": "How does the Health Impact Fund reward participating pharmaceutical innovators? ",
        "q6_answer": "Pharmaceutical innovators can register any new product with the Health Impact Fund and then receive annual reward payments that are tied exclusively to the measured health gains achieved: the larger a product’s contribution to reducing the burden of disease, the higher the reward payment. A registered product is rewarded during its first ten years.",
        "q7": "And how are health gains measured?",
        "q7_answer": "Health gains are measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and assessed through statistical sampling.",
        "q8": "What are quality-adjusted life years?",
        "q8_answer": "The methodology of quality-adjusted life years has been in use for approximately 30 years. One quality-adjusted life year might be, for instance, one additional year of fully healthy life gained by a patient. Or it could be a gain of two life years in poor (50%) health. Or it might involve no lengthening of life at all, but rather an improvement in health only – as when a medicine averts a four-year-long disease that would have reduced the patient’s health from 100% to 75%; this health gain of four times 25% also counts as saving one quality-adjusted life year.",
        "q9": "How do quality-adjusted life years affect the distribution of reward payments?",
        "q9_answer": "Each year, the Health Impact Fund assesses the quality-adjusted life years achieved by each registered drug. Based on these assessments, the fixed annual reward pool is then distributed over the registered products. Thus if, in a given year, some medicine achieves 10% of the health gains produced by all medicines registered with the Health Impact Fund, then this medicine is rewarded with 10% of that year’s reward pool.",
        "q10": "Does the idea of a Health Impact Fund thus far exist only on paper?",
        "q10_answer": "No. There has already been a 5-year pilot project about the measurability of health gains, which included field work in India and was supported by a €2 million grant from the European Research Council. This project has shown how the therapeutic effects of medicines can be assessed even in poor countries.",
        "q11": "How can the Health Impact Fund be realized politically?",
        "q11_answer": "The developers of the Health Impact Fund idea are currently seeking support for another pilot project. Its purpose is to try out the central elements of the Health Impact Fund on a smaller scale – for example, with a single reward pool of €100 million. Pharmaceutical innovators would be invited each to propose one new initiative, involving an already-patented medicine of theirs, toward achieving additional health gains in some impoverished area of the world. An expert committee would select four of these proposals and give them three years for implementation. At the end of the period, the reward pool would be distributed in proportion to the health gains achieved.",
        "q12": "What initiatives might innovators propose for this new pilot project?",
        "q12_answer": "Important selection criteria would be the magnitude and measurability of the expected health gains as well as the proposal’s innovation potential and inclusion of poor population segments. Pharmaceutical innovators might propose, for example, to develop a heat-stable or pediatric version of one of their medicines, or the design of a new product-specific therapy or diagnosis protocol suitable for the tropics. The objective of the pilot is to show that health gains can be reliably and consistently measured. It would also show how much additional health impact can be achieved by means of such new incentives. It is hoped that, with the help of states, foundations and others, such a larger pilot project can soon be implemented.",

        "background": "Background",
        "background_1": "Pharmaceutical research is currently funded from patent-protected markups.",
        "background_1_answer": "The development of new medicines is very expensive. To cover these R&D costs, countries offer 20-year patents. Under the protection of these temporary monopolies, pharmaceutical firms can sell their new products at very high prices. This system has two adverse effects:",
        "background_2": "Little research into diseases of poor people:",
        "background_2_answer": "In the current system, the diseases of the poor are unattractive for pharmaceutical research. This is so because poor patients cannot afford to buy expensive medicines. The diseases of the poor are therefore generally neglected by pharmaceutical companies. Remedies against hair loss are more likely to be sought than remedies against deadly diseases of poverty, such as dengue, leishmaniasis or Ebola.",
        "background_3": "High prices limit access to new drugs:",
        "background_3_answer": "New medicines are generally unaffordable for the poor. Even when new medicines are developed, for example against the hepatitis C virus, they are almost always sold at profit-maximizing monopoly prices. These far exceed what most patients can afford. The same also holds for medicines against global diseases such as cancer.",
        "background_4": "The Health Impact Fund provides a complementary system that strengthens world health.",
        "background_4_answer": "With the Health Impact Fund, pharmaceutical companies obtain an additional option that, through new incentives, mitigates these two adverse effects.",
        "essence": "The Essence",
        "essence_1": "Health gains as the standard.",
        "essence_1_answer": "The purpose of medicines is to improve and preserve health. The Health Impact Fund aligns corporate incentives to engage in research, development and marketing with precisely this social objective. This is so because the reward payments that any innovator receives for its registered innovation are tied directly to the health gains that this medicine achieves year by year. The more a registered product lengthens or improves human lives, the higher are the reward payments that its innovator receives from the Health Impact Fund. In this calculus, the health of all human beings is weighted equally, regardless of whether they are rich or poor.",
        "essence_2": "Covering the costs of pharmaceutical firms.",
        "essence_2_answer": "With the publicly funded reward payments that the Health Impact Fund pays out for each registered medicine, the firm bears the risks of failure in case its product has little health benefit and earns the rewards of success, in case its product is therapeutically very successful. On average, firms should be able to cover their costs and earn a competitive rate of return.",
        "essence_3": "Delinking a medicine’s price from its R&D costs.",
        "essence_3_answer": "Registered medicines must be sold at an affordable price, which covers merely the costs of manufacture and distribution. Such medicines are therefore affordable even to very poor patients.",

        "how_answer": "The Health Impact Fund will be financed by states and charitable foundations. It would give pharmaceutical innovators the option of registering any new product for annual reward payments.",
        "intro": "The Health Impact Fund is intended to provide a complementary system for the development of pharmaceutical innovations – especially ones intended for poor patients who cannot afford expensive medicines.",
        "prices": "Prices",
        "prices_answer": "The price of any product registered with the HIF is limited to the costs of manufacture and distribution, and therefore affordable even for poor patients. The price of registered medicines is delinked from their R&D cost. One way to keep prices down is to enable generic manufacturers to compete in producing and selling registered drugs.",
        "prices_see_more": "Usually, once drugs become generic, prices fall substantially since generic manufacturers compete to sell identical products. Generic competition may not work in all situations, so the HIF might use other tools to ensure low prices, including tendering or regulated prices.",
        "reward": "Reward payments",
        "reward_answer": "The reward payments received by pharmaceutical innovators depend solely on the annual health gains achieved by their registered medicines. The more such a new medicine improves or lengthens human lives, the more money goes to its innovator.",
        "reward_see_more": "An important part of the HIF model is that the HIF should pay out a fixed amount in every year. Registered products obtain a share of the fixed payout equal to their share of assessed health impact of all registered products annually. Thus, firms are essentially competing to improve human health. Having a fixed total payout divided between firms helps the HIF (and funders) to manage its budget. Each registered product would be eligible for ten years of payments, which resembles the duration of exclusivity that firms now enjoy for patented pharmaceuticals. Following the 10 years, products would be required to be licensed for generic production.",

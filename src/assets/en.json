",
        "show_more_3": "Think of a medicine that is mass-produced for $20 and sold for $50,000. Such exorbitant markups are common in the current system, where firms must rely on markups to cover their large up-front costs for research and development. Such huge markups give patent holders  extremely powerful incentives to promote  sales. These incentives lead to myriad abuses that are hard to stamp out; and many patients therefore do not get the treatment that is best for them. With health impact rewards, by contrast, profits are tied to therapeutic success; so firms earn nothing from getting their product prescribed to patients who do not benefit from it.  ",

    "faq": {
        "heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "q1": "Should the Health Impact Fund replace the existing system of incentives?",
        "q1_answer": "Clearly: no. The conventional incentives from patent-protected markups remain in place. The Health Impact Fund  gives pharmaceutical innovators the additional option of registering a new medicine and then receiving reward payments according to health impact.",
        "q2": "How is the Health Impact Fund financed?",
        "q2_answer": "The Health Impact Fund might be financed by states, most plausibly in proportion to their gross national incomes. Another possible source of funding are international taxes that might be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions, say, or on certain destabilizing financial transactions.",
        "q3": "How much money does the Health Impact Fund require?",
        "q3_answer": "To be able to attract an adequate number of products, the Health Impact Fund would need to be funded at minimally €3 billion per year. Of course, it could also work with larger annual reward pools and would then attract a larger number of product registrations.",
        "q4": "Is this amount realistic?",
        "q4_answer": "Clearly: yes. €3 billion per year is less than 0.3% of what the world currently spends on pharmaceuticals. If all countries participated, then each would need to contribute merely 0.0036% of its gross national income to the Health Impact Fund. And these contributions would be offset by substantial savings through reduced spending on registered drugs.",
        "q5": "What if some affluent countries initially don’t want to contribute? ",
        "q5_answer": "Their abstention would have some positive effects as well: medicines that are registered with the Health Impact Fund could still be sold with large patent-protected markups in any non-contributing affluent countries. This opportunity would make it more attractive for pharmaceutical firms to register a new medicine and would also give non-contributing states an incentive to join the Health Impact Fund scheme.",
        "q6": "How does the Health Impact Fund reward participating pharmaceutical innovators? ",
        "q6_answer": "Pharmaceutical innovators can register any new product with the Health Impact Fund and then receive annual reward payments that are tied exclusively to the measured health gains achieved: the larger a product’s contribution to reducing the burden of disease, the higher the reward payment. A registered product is rewarded during its first ten years.",
        "q7": "And how are health gains measured?",
        "q7_answer": "Health gains are measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and assessed through statistical sampling.",
        "q8": "What are quality-adjusted life years?",
        "q8_answer": "The methodology of quality-adjusted life years has been in use for approximately 30 years. One quality-adjusted life year might be, for instance, one additional year of fully healthy life gained by a patient. Or it could be a gain of two life years in poor (50%) health. Or it might involve no lengthening of life at all, but rather an improvement in health only – as when a medicine averts a four-year-long disease that would have reduced the patient’s health from 100% to 75%; this health gain of four times 25% also counts as saving one quality-adjusted life year.",
        "q9": "How do quality-adjusted life years affect the distribution of reward payments?",
        "q9_answer": "Each year, the Health Impact Fund assesses the quality-adjusted life years achieved by each registered drug. Based on these assessments, the fixed annual reward pool is then split among the registered products. Thus if, in a given year, some medicine achieves 10% of the health gains produced by all medicines registered with the Health Impact Fund, then this medicine is rewarded with 10% of that year’s reward pool.",
        "q10": "Does the idea of a Health Impact Fund thus far exist only on paper?",
        "q10_answer": "No. There has already been a 5-year research project on measuring health gains, which included field work in India and was supported by a €2 million grant from the European Research Council. This project has shown how the therapeutic effects of medicines can be assessed even in poorer regions.",
        "q11": "How can the Health Impact Fund be realized politically?",
        "q11_answer": "We are  seeking support for another pilot project. Its purpose is to try out the central elements of the Health Impact Fund on a smaller scale – for example, with a single reward pool of €100 million. Pharmaceutical innovators would be invited each to propose one new initiative, involving an already-patented medicine of theirs, toward achieving additional health gains in some impoverished area of the world. An expert committee would select four of these proposals and give them three years for implementation. At the end of the period, the reward pool would be distributed in proportion to the health gains achieved.",
        "q12": "What initiatives might innovators propose for this  new pilot?",
        "q12_answer": "Important selection criteria would be the magnitude and measurability of the expected health gains as well as the proposal’s innovation potential and inclusion of poor populations. Pharmaceutical innovators might propose, for example, to develop a heat-stable or pediatric version of one of their medicines, or the design of a new product-specific therapy or diagnosis protocol suitable for the tropics. The objective of the pilot is to show that health gains can be reliably and consistently measured. It would also show how much additional health impact can be achieved by means of such new incentives. We hope that, with the help of states, foundations and others, such a larger pilot project can soon be implemented.",

        "background_1_answer": "The development of new medicines is very expensive. To cover these R&D costs, states offer 20-year patents. Under the protection of such temporary monopolies, pharmaceutical firms can sell their new products at very high prices. This system has two adverse effects:",
        "background_2": "Little research into diseases of poor people:",
        "background_2_answer": "In the current system,  diseases concentrated among poor people are unattractive for pharmaceutical research. This is so because poor patients cannot afford to buy expensive medicines. Their diseases are therefore neglected. Pharmaceutical innovators are more likely to seek remedies against hair loss than remedies against deadly diseases of poverty, such as dengue, leishmaniasis or Ebola.",
        "background_3": "High prices limit access to new drugs:",
        "background_3_answer": "New medicines are generally unaffordable for the poor. Even when new medicines are developed, for example against hepatitis C, they are almost always sold at profit-maximizing monopoly prices which far exceed what most patients can afford. The same also holds for medicines against global diseases such as cancer.",
        "background_4": "The Health Impact Fund provides a complementary system that strengthens world health.",

        "essence": "The Essence",
        "essence_1": "Health gains as the standard.",
        "essence_1_answer": "The purpose of medicines is to improve and preserve health. The Health Impact Fund aligns corporate incentives to engage in research, development and marketing with precisely this social objective: the more a registered medicine lengthens or improves human lives, the higher are the reward payments that its innovator receives from the Health Impact Fund. In this calculus, the health of all human beings is weighted equally, regardless of whether they are rich or poor.",
        "essence_2": "Covering the costs of pharmaceutical firms.",
        "essence_2_answer": "With the publicly funded reward payments that the Health Impact Fund disburses for  registered medicines, innovators can cover their costs and earn a competitive rate of return. On average. As with the current system, innovators bear a risk. Research may result in a therapeutically valuable medicine that helps many patients. If it does not, the innovator may earn little for its efforts or nothing at all.",

        "in_short_2_answer": "The price of registered products is limited to the costs of manufacture and distribution, and therefore affordable even for poor patients. The price of registered medicines is delinked from their R&D cost.",

And it encourages  suboptimal treatment with medicines that earn much higher markups than those that are best for the patient.

        "quote_norway_text": "An international Health Impact Fund (HIF) should be established as a supplement to the current patent system. Through Health Impact Fund  pharmaceutical companies can voluntarily register their drugs and commit to making them available at the lowest price against payment of support over ten years from the Fund on the basis of major health impact their drugs have.

        "step_01": "The Health Impact Fund distributes each year a fixed pool of reward money supplied by states, international taxation and/or charitable funders.",
        "step_02": "Pharmaceutical innovators register certain new products with the Health Impact Fund – often ones they would otherwise not have developed – and thereby commit to selling them at a price no higher than the cost of manufacture and distribution.",

        "how_answer": "The Health Impact Fund will be financed by states and charitable foundations. It would give pharmaceutical innovators the option of registering any new product for annual reward payments.",
        "intro": "The Health Impact Fund is intended to provide a complementary system for the development of pharmaceutical innovations – especially ones intended for poor patients who cannot afford expensive medicines.",
        "prices": "Prices",
        "prices_answer": "When a medicine is  registered with the Health Impact Fund, its price is delinked from its R&D costs. Even poor patients can afford such drugs because their price is limited to the costs of manufacture and distribution.  One way of determining this price ceiling is through an organized competition among generic manufacturers.",
        "prices_see_more": "Such competition might take the form of a tender in which  manufacturers compete to produce the needed supply of the registered product in behalf of the registrant. Alternatively, suitable generic manufacturers might receive cost-free licenses to produce and supply the registered product while competing with one another in the market. Where neither of these options works to ensure a reliable and affordable supply, the Health Impact Fund would set a price ceiling based on engineering estimates of manufacturing and distribution costs.",
        "reward": "Reward payments",
        "reward_answer": "The reward payments received by pharmaceutical innovators depend solely on the annual health gains achieved by their registered medicines. The more such a new medicine improves or lengthens human lives, the more money goes to its innovator.",
        "reward_see_more": "An important feature of the Health Impact Fund is that each of its annual reward pools is fixed in advance. This helps the Fund and its funders to manage their budgets. Each pool is split according to the health gains that registered products have achieved in the relevant year. Thus firms are  competing to improve human health.  Each registered product participates in the pay-outs for a period of ten years, which resembles the duration of exclusivity that firms now enjoy under patents. At the end of this reward period, the innovator would be required to license its registered product for generic production, regardless of any unexpired patents.",
